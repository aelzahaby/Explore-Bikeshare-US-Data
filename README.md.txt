# Explore Bikeshare US Data
This is part of the programming for Data Science with Python nanodegree

## Project overview
This project explores the bikeshare data in three major cities in the US - Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I imported data using Pandas to try to solve some interesting questions using **descriptive statistics**.

## Software needed:
The software needed to complete this project was a text editor and the shoftware I chose was **Visual Studio Code**. However, you can use other text editors such as _Atom_ or _Sublime_.

## Datasets
The data used in this project was provided by **Motivate**, which is a bikeshare system provider in the United states. I used a dataset that consisted of 6 months in 2017. The core columns used in this project were:
* Start Time
* End Time
* Trip Duration
* Start Station
* End Station
* User Type
* Gender
* Birth Year
It should be noted that Gender and Birth year were not in the **Washington** dataset.
