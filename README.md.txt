# Explore Bikeshare US Data
This is part of the programming for Data Science with Python nanodegree

## Project overview
This project explores the bikeshare data in three major cities in the US - Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I imported data using Pandas to try to solve some interesting questions using **descriptive statistics**.

## Software needed:
The software needed to complete this project was a text editor and the shoftware I chose was **Visual Studio Code**. However, you can use other text editors such as _Atom_ or _Sublime_.
